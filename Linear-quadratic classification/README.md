# Linear and quadratic classification

This folder provides MATLAB implementation for a few probabilistic graphical models algorithms :

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

Running the main function (main.m) gives the classification errors on both training and testing sets.
