# Hidden Markov Models implementation

These files provide MATLAB implementation for a Hidden Markov Model, to account for a possible temporal structure of data.

The README.pdf file explains exhaustively the context as well as the implemented algorithms :

- Kmeans
- Expectation-Maximization
- Viterbi algorithm

One can easily change the datasets and adapt the code so as to run the algorithms on its own datasets.
