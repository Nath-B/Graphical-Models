# Linear and quadratic classification

This folder provides MATLAB implementation for a few probabilistic graphical models algorithms :

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

Running the main function (main.m) gives the classification errors on both training and testing sets, for datasets in the "classification_data" folder.
Datasets are constructed as follows : every line is a vector of features, the last feature (i.e the last column) being the binary label 0/1.

One can easily change the datasets and adapt the code so as to run the algorithms on its own datasets.
